The main goal is to create an online portal where customers can seek for or provide a service to others.

The current and main focus is on activities practiced online e.g.: yoga instructor offering online yoga classes.

The service keeps records of customers and their:

- Necessary personal details.
- Services they provide / consume.
- A timetable to ease time management.
- Rating / review information.

Customers must register into our system.
The system acts as a platform, the payment process is *not our responsibility!*
